# Demo of Deep Learning Models for Time Series Forecasting

<!-- ## Introduction to Time Series Forecasting -->

Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on previously observed values over time. If you have data collected over time, such as sales figures, temperatures, or stock prices, you can analyze historical patterns to make informed predictions about future trends. This can be incredibly useful in various fields, including finance, economics, and operations.

## Try Our Interactive Demo

We invite you to explore our demo, where you can paste your own time series data and see the forecast generated by advanced deep learning models. Here’s how it works:

1. **Input Your Data**: Simply copy and paste your time series data into the provided text box. The data should be in a simple format, separated by commas.

    For example:
    ```
    112, 118, 132, 129, 121, 135, 148, 148, 136, 119
    ```

2. **Adjust the Forecast Horizon**: Use the slider to select the forecast horizon in months. This allows you to specify how far into the future you want the predictions to extend.

3. **Automatic Forecasting**: Once you've pasted your data and adjusted the forecast horizon, the system will automatically generate forecasts for you, providing visualizations to help you understand the predictions.

4. **Visualize the Results**: The demo will plot both your historical data and the forecast, complete with confidence intervals, so you can see the predicted values in context.
